In this data, Each row appears to be about a prticular planet or other body in the Solar System, named in the **eName** column. The **mass_kg** column is clearly the measure of a *property* of the body so we expect at least one TN like\n",

    "\n",
    "We'll want the other columns to help make the subject phrase more informative than just the **eName**.  Or, those columns might be used as values of a property like **mass** was. [A little research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_planet) shows us that classification and naming of solar system bodies is not simple. Planets orbit the sun by definition, and all but the major planets we learned in grade-school are considered *minor planets*.  The International Astronomical Union (IAU) prefers the term *small Solar System body* but we'll stick with *minor planet*. Five of them have been designated *dwarf planets* because they share hydrostatic properties with the major planets. The data at hand does give us information that would let us generate proper subject phrases, but in kind of an oblique way.\n",
    "\n",
    "**isPlanet**, if **True**, tells us that the object is some kind of a planet. **orbit_type** does too, by calling a solar orbit *primary* and *secondary* is for *satellites* of some other body, usually a planet, named in the **orbits** column.  For some reason, that column is blank for planets instead of containing *sun*.  The **eName** signals the major planets by having no number in front of the name, but there appears to be no indication of *dwarf planet* status, so we either ignore that distinction or just use the knowledge that there are only 5 of them in building our subject phrases.  \n",
